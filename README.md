# Final project for the University of British Columbia's [*Programming in Python for Data Science*](https://prog-learn.mds.ubc.ca/en) course (Jan-Mar 2024)

## Introduction and explanatory comments
This [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org) is my work on the final project for the UBC data science course, *Programming in Python for Data Science* (PPDS).

The PPDS course itself forms the one prequisite course component for the [*Key Capabilities in Data Science* certificate](https://extendedlearning.ubc.ca/programs-credentials/key-capabilities-data-science-certificate) offered by the [Extended Learning](https://extendedlearning.ubc.ca/) department.

## The project
Taking reported data from the Disney Corporation for the years 1991-2016 (see licensing and references below), we were to analyse the following 5 files:

```
- disney-characters.csv
- disney-director.csv
- disney-voice-actors.csv
- disney_movies_total_gross.csv
- disney_revenue_1991-2016.csv
```

You will need to run a Jupyter server to see the Altair charts included in the attached notebook.

All five of these comprise the **Disney Character Success** dataset by Kelly Garrett, available at https://data.world/kgarrett/disney-character-success-00-16, **and licensed under the CC-BY license only**.

All other notebooks, code and files are under the MIT License.
